Project title:
•	Multiple Games in One Web App

Project Description:
•	In this project, I made two games named “Guess The Number” and “Rolling Dice”, and combined them onto a single website. This is a user-based website i.e They can create accounts and then log in to the site. The rules of the game will also be mentioned in the respective gaming sites.
•	I have used HTML, CSS, JS for the front-end part of the project. For the back-end part of the project, I have used SQLite and Django. I run the trial and error in the IDE Visual Studio Code in my x64 based Operating System laptop.
•	This project is a way to escape boredom and non-productive hours. People of any age group can play this game as the rules of the games are very simple. 

How to use the project:
•	At first user has to run the manage.py file in their IDE. Then opening “new terminal” they have to give command “python manage.py runserver” and press Enter. A local host at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ will run. Then User has to select which game he/she will play first and click on that particular game. This will take the user to the gaming site and there they can create accounts first, and then login.


Future Plan:
•	Till now, my project has only two games and it runs on local host but when it will be global, I want to increase as more engagement as possible. I will add more super interesting and fun games and will name it “Gamers Guild”.
